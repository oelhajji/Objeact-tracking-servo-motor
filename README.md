# Objeact-tracking-servo-motor
This project combines **Raspberry Pi**, **OpenCV**, **PiCamera**, and **Arduino** to create a real-time object tracking system using color detection. The Raspberry Pi processes visual data, tracks a colored object, and sends control signals to servos connected to an Arduino to adjust their orientation accordingly.
